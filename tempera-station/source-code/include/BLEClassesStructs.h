/**
 * @brief Data structure for the characteristics of the environmental sensing service.
 * 
 * This structure represents the characteristics of the environmental sensing service.
 * Unions are used to write and retrieve data from the characteristics.
 * The `__packed__` attribute is used to ensure correct alignment of data bytes in memory, 
 * necessary when writing to characteristics.
 * 
 * The accuracy translates to a multiplier that has to be used when writing a value to a characteristic.
 * So if we want to transmit a temperature of 4 Â°C we need to write a value of 4/0.01 = 400 to the characteristic.
 * 
 * The NMVOC characteristic uses a medfloat16 value (see ISO/IEEE 11073-20601) according to the specifications.
 * For our purpose we simplify this by using a scaled uint16_t value.
